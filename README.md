# MA4N1_Platonic_Solids

Project aims: Prove that there exist only 5 platonic solids.

Current progress:
- We have shown that the inequality $(m-2)(n-2)<4$ can be derived from the Handshake Lemmas and Euler's Characteristic Formula.
- We have shown that the inequality has only 5 solutions when $m$ and $n$ are natural numbers.
